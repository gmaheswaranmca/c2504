#i
Normalization:
    process of organizing the fields and tables 
    of a relational database 
    to minimize 
        redundancy and 
        dependency.
#ii
Normalization decomposes a Relation into rows or more smaller relations.

#iii
After normalization, 
the data may be retrieved after joined several relations.

#iv 
Relation is in 1NF
    if each column contains atomic values.
Note: 
    atomic value means single valued.
    ie no repeating group 

Example:

              Calculus                 
To 
There, repeating groups in relation. 
So, remove it to get 1NF.

databse is in 1NF 
    all non-key depends on the key
    and all attributes in R are atomic.

#v 
Relation is in 2NF 
    if it is in 1NF 
    and every non-key depends fully on key.
Note: 
    partial functional dependency : if each non-key depends on sub set of key 
    Fully   functional dependency : if non-key does not depend on sub set of key 
                            or 
                            if each non-key depends only on key (not any sub set of key)

#vi
Relation is in 3NF 
    if it is in 2NF 
    and non-key does not depend on another non-key. 
Note: 
    transitive functional dependency: if non-key depends on another non-key.

Relation is in BCNF 
    if it is in 3NF     
    and part of key does not depend on non-key. 
Note: 
    nontrivial functional dependency: 
        if non-key fully depends on key and non-key is not subset of key.

#viii
Relation is in 4NF 
    if it is in BCNF     
    and has no multi-valued attr.
Note: 
    mvd (multivalued dependency)
    multi-valued dependencies: 
        where one attribute determines a set of values 
        independently of other attributes.

Eliminate multi-valued dependencies 
to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

#ix
Relation is in 5NF (PJNF - Projection-Join Normal Form) 
    if it is in 4NF     
    and if every join dependency is implied by the candidate keys.

Decompose tables to remove redundancy that arises from join dependencies.

To collaborate effectively on a WPF project with your team of four and minimize conflicts when working on individual pages, follow these steps using Git for version control:

1. Project Setup and Branching Strategy
   - Main Branch (or Master): Create a `main` branch, which holds the stable version of the project.
   - Feature Branches: Each team member should create their own feature branch for the page or feature they are working on. For example:
     - `feature/home-page`
     - `feature/about-page`
     - `feature/contact-page`
   This way, each of you works in isolation, reducing the chances of conflicts.

2. Pull Requests and Code Reviews
   - Once a feature is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to the `main` branch. This helps to:
     - Review code.
     - Ensure no conflicts.
     - Allow others to comment or suggest improvements before merging.
   
3. Componentization and Modular Development
   - Modular Design: Structure your WPF project such that each page or component is separate and self-contained. This can be achieved by:
     - Using UserControls for individual components/pages.
     - Dividing shared resources (styles, templates, etc.) into separate resource files to avoid conflicts in `App.xaml`.
   
4. Frequent Pulls from Main Branch
   - Regularly pull changes from the `main` branch 
   into your feature branches to stay updated with others' work. 
   This minimizes major conflicts when merging.
   
5. Communication and Task Management
   - Use a tool like Trello, Jira, or GitHub Projects 
   to track who is working on which page/feature.
   - Regularly communicate with your team to avoid overlapping work.
   
6. Handle Merge Conflicts
   - If conflicts do arise, 
   use Git's merge tools (e.g., in Visual Studio, VSCode, or GitKraken) 
   to resolve them. Focus on:
     - Merging `.xaml` files carefully, 
     especially when dealing with shared resources (styles, templates, etc.).
   
7. Version Control Workflow
   Here’s the workflow you can follow:

   - Step 1: Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch.
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```
   
   - Step 2: Switch to your feature branch and 
   merge any changes from `main` (this helps avoid conflicts later).
     ```bash
     git checkout feature/home-page
     git merge main
     ```
   
   - Step 3: After resolving conflicts (if any), 
   push your changes to your feature branch.
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/home-page
     ```

   - Step 4: Open a Pull Request when your feature is ready.

8. Git Ignore
   - Ensure that generated files (such as build artifacts) are 
   in the `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.

By using this approach, each team member can work 
on individual tasks without stepping on each other’s toes, and the project will be smoothly integrated through feature branches and pull requests.

Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard  
   This project aims 
   to create an interactive dashboard 
   that aggregates and visualizes data 
   from various manufacturing processes. 
   By leveraging real-time data analytics, 
   users can monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), 
   identify bottlenecks, and optimize production efficiency. 
   The dashboard will integrate with SQL Server for data storage and 
   provide insights through dynamic charts and graphs.

Abstract for the Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard

The Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard is 
an innovative application designed 
to enhance operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making 
in manufacturing environments. 
By integrating real-time data analytics with a user-friendly interface, 
the dashboard empowers users to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), 
visualize production metrics, and identify bottlenecks 
across various manufacturing processes. 
Utilizing SQL Server for robust data management and storage, 
the application enables seamless access to critical production data, 
allowing users to generate comprehensive reports and alerts for any anomalies.

The dashboard's interactive features provide insights into production trends, 
facilitating timely interventions and continuous improvement. 
With a focus on optimizing production efficiency and ensuring product quality, 
the Smart Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard serves as an essential tool 
for manufacturers striving to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving industry. 
This application not only streamlines data collection and analysis 
but also fosters collaboration among teams, 
ultimately driving better outcomes 
in product lifecycle management and operational performance.

Explanation of the Tables:

1. Users: Stores user information, including credentials and roles (e.g., admin, operator).

2. ProductionLines: Represents different production lines or machines 
in the manufacturing facility.

3. ProductionMetrics: Captures performance metrics 
for each production line, including production rate, 
efficiency, quality rate, and downtime.

4. Alerts: Records alerts related to production issues, 
including type, severity, and resolution status.

5. Settings: Stores application configuration settings that can be adjusted as needed.

6. ProductionTrends: Holds historical data for analyzing production trends over time.

Note
Make sure to customize the data types and constraints 
based on your specific application requirements. 
Also, consider implementing indexes on frequently queried columns 
to optimize performance.

2. ProductionLine to ProductionMetric: 
   - One production line can have multiple production metrics recorded. (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: ProductionLine.LineID → ProductionMetric.LineID

3. ProductionLine to Alert: 
   - One production line can generate multiple alerts. (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: ProductionLine.LineID → Alert.LineID

4. ProductionLine to ProductionTrend: 
   - One production line can have multiple production trends recorded. (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: ProductionLine.LineID → ProductionTrend.LineID

ER Diagram Overview

- The User entity is connected to the Alert entity, 
indicating that users can create alerts, 
though this relationship is typically optional.
- The ProductionLine entity serves as a central hub, 
with multiple one-to-many relationships 
to the ProductionMetric, Alert, and ProductionTrend entities.
- The Setting entity stands alone as it is not directly related 
to other entities but can be referenced for application configuration.

Diagram Representation
While I can't create visual diagrams directly, 
the ER diagram can be visualized as follows:

```
[User] 1 --------< [Alert]
   |
   |
[ProductionLine] 1 --------< [ProductionMetric]
   |
   |
   1 --------< [ProductionTrend]
```

Usage:
- After running these `INSERT` statements, your tables will be populated with sample data that you can use for development and testing.
- You can modify this data further to meet specific scenarios you want to test (e.g., edge cases, high vs low efficiency, various alert types, etc.).

Would you like any additional data, or help with visualizing this data in your dashboard?
